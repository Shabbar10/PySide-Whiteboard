# Whiteboard Application
Using PySide6 to make a Whiteboard with (potentially) over-the-network capabilities.

## Progress So Far
- Can draw
- Can erase
- Can change size of the pen using the dial
- Can change colour
- Can clear the screen
- Undo & Redo

## TODO
- Open new whiteboard
- Have pages within a single whiteboard
- Save and load whiteboards
- Give access to users (Google Drive-esque)
- Have users working on the same whiteboard from different PCs

## To Get Started
Optional: Have a virtual environment: `python -m venv <name of environemt>`

```python
pip install pyside6
```

Run main.py
